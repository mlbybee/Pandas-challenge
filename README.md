Module 4 
Pandas - Challenge Assignment

Description:

This assignment includes analyzing the district-wide standardized test results for both reading and math for grades 9 through 12. 

The data provided included: School ID, School Name, Type of School, Size, Budget, Student ID, Student Name, Gender, Grade, Reading Score, and Math Score. 

The following information was gathered from the data provided within two data sets (school data and student data):
    
    - School Summary
    - Highest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)
    - Lowest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)
    - Math Scores by Grade
    - Reading Scores by Grade
    - Scores by School Spending
    - Scores by School Size
    - Scores by School Type
    
District-Wide Conclusions:

1. Charter school outperformed District schools in both reading and math scores and had a dramatically higher overall passing rate. This could be due to Charter schools typically serving smaller student populations per school. 

    Charter schools passing rate = 90.4%
   
    District schools passing rate = 53.6%
    
3. Smaller to medium school size schools outperformed larger school sizes on math and reading performances had an increased overall passing rate. This could be due to the teacher to student ratio at these schools.

    Large school passing rate = 58.2%
   
    Medium school passing rate = 90.6%
   
    Small school passing rate = 89.8%
